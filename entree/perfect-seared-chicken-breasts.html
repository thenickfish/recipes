  name: PERFECT SEARED CHICKEN BREASTS
  blurb: FROM THE WHOLE 30-PAGE 157
  prep_time: 5 minutes
  cook_time: 20-25 minutes
  total_time: 30 minutes
  makes: serves 2
  ingredients:
  - 2 PORTIONS, 5 OZ. EACH, SKINLESS BONELESS CHICKEN BREASTS
  - 1/2 TEASPOON SALT
  - 1/4 TEASPOON BLACK PEPPER
  - 2 TABLESPOONS COOKING FAT
  steps:
  - PREHEAT the oven to 350F
  - SEASON the chicken breasts evenly on both sides with the salt and pepper. In a large oven- safe skillet, melt the cooking fat over medium- high heat, swimming to coat the bottom of the pan. When the fat is hot, place the chicken top (rounded) side down in the pan and sear for 3 to 4 minutes. Your chicken should pull of the pan easily once you have proper sear. Using tongs, turn the chicken over, then put the entire pan in the oven to finish cooking.
  - BAKE for 10 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of the chicken, until the internal temperature reaches 160F. Let chicken rest for 5 minutes before serving.
