  makes: SERVES 4
  ingredients:
  - 1 CLOVE GARLIC, MINED
  - JUICE OF 1 LEMON
  - 1/4 CUP EXTRA VIRGIN OLIVE OIL
  - 1 MEDIUM HEAD GREEN CABBAGE, FINELY SHREDDED
  - 1 CUT SHREDDED CARROTS
  - 1/4 CUP CHOPPED CASHEWS
  - 1 TEASPOON SESAME SEEDS
  - 1/2 TEASPOON SALT
  - 1/2 TEASPOON BLACK PEPPER
  - 1 TABLESPOON RIBBON-CHOPPED BASIL 1/4 HEAD PURPLE CABBAGE (OPTIONAL)
  - SAVE TIME and use 4 cups of packaged shredded cabbage or use 2 cups of packaged shredded cabbage mixed with 2 cups broccoli slaw. Adding a thinly sliced Granny Smith apple would also give the slaw a bite of tartness.
  - A MAYO BASED DRESSING would contribute a bit more creaminessâ€”just replace the olive oil with 1/4 cup basic mayonnaise.
  - For a SPICY SLAW, instead of lemon oil mix the slaw with a dressing of 1/4 cup apple cider vinegar, 1/4 cup Whole30 Ketchup, and 1 teaspoon hot sauce.
  steps:
  - WHISK the garlic and lemon juice in a mixing bowl. While whisking, slowly add the olive oil in a steady stream until fully blended.
  - IN a large bowl, combine the cabbage carrots cashews, and sesame seeds. Mix together and toss with lemon oil. Adjust seasoning with salt and pepper and top with basil.
