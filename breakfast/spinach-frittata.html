  makes: SERVES 3
  ingredients:
  - 6 LARGE EGGS, BEATEN
  - 1/4 TEASPOON SALT
  - 1/4 TEASPOON BLACK PEPPER
  - 2 TABLESPOONS COOKING FAT
  - 1/2 ONION, DICED
  - 1 CUP DICED SEEDED TOMATO, PLUS A FEW SLICES FOR TOPPING THE FRITTATA
  - 1 9 OZ. BAG BABY SPINACH, ROUGH CHOP GRATES ZEST AND JUICE OF 1/4 LEMON
  - Mix and match vegetables and meat to vary flavors of your frittatas. Try making it Mexican (spiced cooked ground beef, thinly sliced jalape√±os, diced tomato, and cilantro), Italian (cooked sausage, red peppers, onions, and basil), Greek (cooke chicken, sun-dried tomatoes, black olives, and artichoke hearts), or use any leftover meat and vegetables you happen to have in your fridge for a kitchen sink frittata.
  steps:
  - SET the oven to broil (or preheat to 500F)
  - IN a mixing bowl, whisk the eggs with the salt and pepper.
  - HEAT a large oven-safe skillet over medium heat. Add the cooking fat to the pan and swirl to coat the bottom. When the fat is hot, add the onion and tomato and cook, stirring, until softened, 2 to 3 minutes.
  - ADD the spinach and let it wilt for 30 seconds. Add the eggs and fold them into the vegetables with a rubber spatula. Cook, without stirring to let the eggs set on the bottom and sides of the pan, until the eggs are firm and still appear wet, 3 to 4 minutes. Lay a few tomato slices on top. Drizzle the lemon juice and sprinkle the lemon zest over the top.
  - TRANSFER the pan with the eggs to the oven and broil 4 to 6 inches from the heat (or bake in the preheated oven) for 3 to 5 minutes, until the top is golden brown. Cut into slices and serve hot out of the pan
