  blurb: FROM WILL IT SKILLET?
  prep_time: 10 MINUTES
  cook_time: 5 MINUTES
  total_time: 15 MINUTES
  makes: SERVES 1
  ingredients:
  - 1 SLICE SANDWICH BREAD
  - 2 TEASPOONS SALTED BUTTER, SOFTENED 1 LARGE EGG
  - SALT, PEPPER, HOT SAUCE
  - VARIATION Garnish with chopped fresh chives or dill sprinkled on the egg
  - TIP To soften butter quickly, cut it into small pieces and press down on the pieces with your thumb. Your body heat will warm the butter. Or use a vegetable peeler to shave off then ribbons, which will come quickly to room temperature.
  steps:
  - PREHEAT the skillet over medium heat for 2 minutes.
  - SPREAD each side of the bread with butter while the skillet heats.
  - USE a cup with a mouth about 2-1/2 inches in diameter to cut a hole out of the center of the bread by pressing into the bread while twisting the cup back and forth. Remove the circle of bread from the enter and place both pieces in the skillet.
  - CRACK the egg into a ramekin or small cup, then pour it into the center of the bread.
  - COOK until the bread is golden brown, about 2 minutes. (Check the circle of bread; with no egg, itâ€™s easier.)
  - USE spatula to flip both pieces of bread, and continue to cook until the bread is golden brown, about 2 minutes.
  - REMOVE the bread and egg from the skillet, sprinkle the egg with salt, pepper, and hot sauce to taste.
